  /**
   * A replay implementation for an I/O layer. This only works if the I/O interface is a {@link
   * java.lang.FunctionalInterface functional interface}.
   *
   * <p>an example of proper usage looks like:
   *
   * <pre>
   * {@code new ExampleSubsystem(IOLayer::replay)}
   * </pre>
   *
   * <p>Use of this function is preferable to something like:
   *
   * <pre>
   * {@code new ExampleSubsystem(new ExampleIOLayer() {}) }
   * </pre>
   *
   * @implNote This function does not actually do anything and is functionally equivalent to
   *     <pre>{@code (inputs) -> {}}</pre>
   *     However, this allows us to avoid allocating multiple lambda objects.
   * @param <T> The type of the loggable inputs
   * @param value The inputs a real or simulated I/O abstraction would modify; these are ignored in
   *     replay so they can accurately be restored from a log file.
